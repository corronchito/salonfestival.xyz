		<p>But I would rather be horizontal.</p>
		<p>I am not a tree with my root in the soil</p>
		<p>Sucking up minerals and motherly love</p>
		<p>So that each March I may gleam into leaf,</p>
    	<p>Nor am I the beauty of a garden bed</p>
		<p>Attracting my share of Ahs and spectacularly painted,</p>
		<p>Unknowing I must soon unpetal.</p>
		<p>Compared with me, a tree is immortal</p>
		<p>And a flower-head not tall, but more startling,</p>
		<p>And I want the one's longevity and the other's daring.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="second">
		<p>Tonight, in the infinitesimal light of the stars,</p>
		<p>The trees and the flowers have been strewing their cool odors.</p>
		<p>I walk among them, but none of them are noticing.</p>
		<p>Sometimes I think that when I am sleeping</p>
		<p>I must most perfectly resemble them -- </p>
		<p>Thoughts gone dim.</p>
		<p>It is more natural to me, lying down.</p>
		<p>Then the sky and I are in open conversation,</p>
		<p>And I shall be useful when I lie down finally:</p>
		<p>Then the trees may touch me for once, and the flowers have time for me.</p>
