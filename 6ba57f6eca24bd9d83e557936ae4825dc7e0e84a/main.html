			<p>Wohnzimmeradventures

			December. Time to hide you might say – summer tan’s gone and who is that sun they always talk about? For many, the advent of Christ is filling up depleted energy levels. Some revert to coffee, others exchange their favourite Pokémon. But nothing is as powerful in combatting Midwinter’s depression than friends. Friends to chat with, to cuddle, to make coffee for, to play games with, to undress, to argue with, to love. That’s why we propose to expand the horizons of pre-Christmas advents in a week-long session of adventures of friendship. Instead of a ship, we offer you our Wohnzimmer. 

			What week? — Starting on Thursday 13th, ending on Wednesday 19th. December 2018.

			What the fuck are we going to do during an entire week? — There will be activities ranging from concerts to silent meditation, ice hockey to workshops about robots and the ocean, from group sauna to group masturbation, from introductions on coffee-making to rap battles. We are open for suggestions! If you wish to propose an activity, we would be happy and honoured > drop the suggestion like it’s cold as Christmas in our email inbox.

			Friends, amies et amis, Freundinnen und Freunde, time to send a message.
