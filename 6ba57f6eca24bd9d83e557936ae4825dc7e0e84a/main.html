			<p>December. Time to hide you might say – summer tan’s gone and who is that sun they always talk about? For many, the <span class="yellow">advent</span> of Christ is filling up depleted energy levels. Some revert to coffee, others exchange their favourite Pokémon. But nothing is as powerful in combatting Midwinter’s depression than <span class="red">friends</span>. <span class="red">Friends</span> to chat with, to cuddle, to make coffee for, to play games with, to undress, to argue with, to love. That’s why we propose to expand the horizons of pre-Christmas advents in a week-long session of <span class="yellow">advent</span>ures of <span class="red">friend</span><span class="magenta">ship</span>. Instead of a <span class="magenta">ship</span>, we offer you our <span class="green">Wohnzimmer</span>.</p> 

			<p>What week? — Starting on Thursday <span class="cyan">13th</span>, ending on Wednesday <span class="cyan">19th</span>. <span class="cyan">December</span> 2018.</p>

			<p>What the fuck are we going to do during an entire week? — There will be activities ranging from concerts to silent meditation, ice hockey to workshops about robots and the ocean, from group sauna to group masturbation, from introductions on coffee-making to rap battles. We are open for suggestions! If you wish to propose an activity, we would be happy and honoured > drop the suggestion like it’s cold as Christmas in our email inbox.</p>

			<p>Friends, amies et amis, Freundinnen und Freunde, time to send a message.</p>
