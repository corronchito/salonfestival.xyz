			<h2 class="separators">WHAT.</h2>
			<p>	December. Time to hide you might say – summer tan’s gone and who is that sun they always talk about anyways?
					For many, the <span class="yellow">advent</span> of Christ is filling up depleted energy levels.
					Some revert to coffee, others exchange their favourite Pokémon.
					But nothing is as powerful in combatting midwinter’s depression than <span class="red">friends</span>.
					<span class="red">Friends</span> to chat with, to cuddle, to make tea for, to play games with, to undress, to argue with, to love.
					That’s why we propose to expand the horizons of pre-Christmas advents in a week-long session of <span class="yellow">advent</span>ures of <span class="red">friend</span><span class="magenta">ship</span>.
					Instead of a <span class="magenta">ship</span>, we offer you our <span class="green">Wohnzimmer</span> = living room(s). </p>

			<h2 class="separators">WHEN.</h2>
			<p>	What week, you wonder? — Starting on Thursday <span class="cyan">13th</span>, ending on Wednesday <span class="cyan">19th of December</span> 2018.	</p>

			<h2 class="separators">WTF.</h2>
			<p>	What the fuck are we going to do during an entire week?
					— There will be activities ranging from concerts to silent meditation, from playing ice hockey to workshops
					about robots and the ocean, from group sauna to introductions to coffee-making.
					We have ideas, but we need you to turn them into reality <span class="blue">> see below!</span> <span class="bold">Once you confirm you’re coming</span>,
					we’ll send you a list of activities to choose from and will then build your custom timetable. </p>

			<h2 class="separators">$$$.</h2>
			<p>	As per the cash question: it will be necessary to cover some expenses.
					As soon as we know who is coming, we will do the math to figure out how small we need your contribution to be.
					Some food and drinks will be taken care of. We will try our best to provide spots to sleep for everyone. </p>

			<h2 class="separators">RSVP.</h2>
			<p>	Friends, amies et amis, Freundinnen und Freunde, we eagerly await that you fill the following form:<br><br>
					<a href="form.html" class="magenta bold straight">&#8605; JOIN US &#8604;</a><br></p>

			<h2 class="separators">DEADline.</h2>
					<p>Please reply by:<br>
					<span class="magenta bold">Sunday 18th of November</span></p>


			<h2 class="separators">ACTIVITIES.</h2>
			<p>	<span class="blue">Here are some activities</span> which we will host ourselves:<br>
			- … </p>

			<p>	If you wish to <span class="blue">propose an activity</span>, we would be happy and honoured
					> drop the suggestion like it’s cold as Christmas in our email inbox. Some things to keep in mind: <br>
					- Activities can be inside or outside<br>
					- You will be responsible for your activity<br>
					- Activities can take between 15 minutes and a day or a night<br>
					- Friends who confirmed they’re coming will choose activities so you can be sure you’re not activing alone<br>
					- For all the rest, we will get in touch with you! </p>
